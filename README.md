##Overview

The ulyaoth module installs the Ulyaoth YUM repository on all [RHEL variants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#RHEL-based) including Fedora.

##Module description

The [Ulyaoth](https://community.ulyaoth.net/threads/ulyaoth-repositories.3/) repository contains up-to-date versions of some popular server programs such as Tomcat and Nginx, as well as other tools like Logstash-Forwarder and Kibana, packaged in the RPM-format. For a list of available packages please check the [project's GitHub](https://github.com/sbagmeijer/ulyaoth/tree/master/Repository) and the dedicated [community forums](https://community.ulyaoth.net/forums/repository/).

This module is suitable for systems which use the YUM package manager, ie. RHEL variants, and for the x86_64 architecture only.

##Setup

ulyaoth will affect the following parts of your system:

* Ulyaoth YUM repositories
* Ulyaoth GPG key

Including the main class is enough to get started. It will install the Ulyaoth repository as described above.

include ::ulyaoth
```

####A couple of examples

  â€¦
  gpgcheck => 0
}
```
